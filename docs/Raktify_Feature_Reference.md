# Raktify — Feature Reference

> **Snapshot date:** 21 May 2026 — for the 27 May 2026 donor / partner meeting.
> Authoritative source for *what is built*. The Master Prompt (`docs/Raktify_Master_Prompt.md`)
> remains the source for *what the product is supposed to be*. The Demo Guide
> (`docs/Raktify_Demo_Guide.md`) is the step-by-step runbook for live walk-throughs.

Raktify is a life-critical blood donation and emergency-request platform
operated by **Choudhari EduHealth India Foundation** (Amravati, Maharashtra).
The product is built across 8 sequential phases. As of this snapshot all 8
phases are **code-complete** and live on Azure staging at
**`raktify.choudhari.ngo`**.

## 1. Architecture at a glance

| Layer | Technology | Hosted on |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| Database | PostgreSQL 17 with Row-Level Security on every table | Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server (B1ms, Central India) |
| Backend API | Node.js 22 LTS + Express + pg | Azure App Service (Linux B1) |
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite 5 + Tailwind 3 PWA + React Query 5 | Azure Static Web Apps (Free, Central India) |
| Auth — donors / coordinators | Mobile OTP (planned MSG91; staging echoes `dev_otp` for demos) | — |
| Auth — institutions | Email + bcrypt + TOTP | — |
| Notifications | Provider abstraction: console / msg91 / **whatsapp_cloud** (Meta) | Backend service |
| Encryption | AES-256-GCM (local key, env-managed); KMS provider stub ready for AWS or Azure Key Vault | — |
| File storage | Local disk in dev; S3 provider scaffolded | — |
| Digital MoU | LeegAlly (Aadhaar eSign) — local provider works in dev | — |
| Geography | Local Government Directory (LGD) bulk importer | — |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions with Azure OIDC federated identity | `.github/workflows/main_raktify-api-staging.yml` + Static Web Apps workflow |

**Key architecture decisions** (full discussion in `CLAUDE.md` and the
Master Prompt):

- **Patient-safety rules live in the database**, not application code. CHECK
  constraints, triggers, and RLS — application code has bugs, constraints
  don't.
- **`audit_log` is INSERT-only and hash-chained.** Only the `audit_writer`
  Postgres role can write to it. No application role has UPDATE or DELETE.
- **Donor PII is masked from hospitals.** Mobile numbers are never returned
  to the hospital role.
- **Self-reported blood group is never used in matching.** Only
  `donors.blood_group_verified` (writable solely by `blood_bank` role) is
  queried during the matching engine.
- **Migrations are immutable once applied.** The runner refuses to re-apply
  a migration whose checksum changed.

---

## 2. Roles and what each one can do

The system has 9 distinct roles (4 user-bearing + 4 special + 1 magic-link).
Every database table is gated by Row-Level Security keyed off
`raktify.actor_role` and `raktify.actor_user_id`.

| Role | Identity | Auth | What it can do | What it cannot do |
|------|----------|------|----------------|-------------------|
| **donor** | A person who donates blood | Mobile OTP | Register, set availability, update consent, view own donation history & TTI clearance (verdict only, never field-level results), RSVP to camps, raise a citizen-tier request | See other donors' PII, see inventory, see request matching engine internals |
| **coordinator** | NGO volunteer in a district | Mobile OTP | See district open-request queue, accept / claim assignment, verify Tier 3/4 requests, mark donor no-shows, close requests with bag IDs, post cross-role thread messages, enrol thalassemia patients, schedule camps | See another district's data, write to `audit_log`, modify clinical reference data |
| **hospital** | Institutional user at an onboarded hospital | Email + password + TOTP | Raise requests, see own request history, confirm crossmatch, see district inventory **counts** (never bag IDs) | See donor mobile numbers, see other hospitals' requests, modify inventory |
| **blood_bank** | Institutional user at an onboarded blood bank | Email + password + TOTP | Record donations, run TTI screening, dual-eyes verify TTI, manage inventory (recall, reserve, issue), respond to incoming requests via Raise-Hand, enrol rare-blood donors | Modify another bank's inventory, override TTI without 4-eyes |
| **ngo_admin** | NGO operations staff | Email + password + TOTP | Verify institution applications, send MoU eSign, verify coordinators, manage duplicates, review lookback investigations, query audit log, run scheduler jobs manually, view all reports | Write to `audit_log` directly, modify clinical reference data |
| **super_admin** | Platform super-user | Email + password + TOTP | Everything ngo_admin can plus suspend institutions, decommission coordinators | Bypass `audit_log` constraints |
| **system** | Service-account context for triggers, scheduled jobs, notification chokepoint | none (set by middleware) | Insert into `audit_log`, run cross-table reads for routing notifications, run match engine inside requests | Be authenticated as via API |
| **onboarding** | Synthetic role used by public apply endpoints (`/onboarding/apply`, `/camps/apply`, `/camps/host`) | none | Insert institutions / camp applications in `PE` (pending) state only | Read any data, write any other state |
| **camp_organizer** | Magic-link bearer for one camp | Token IS the credential | Read their camp's roster (name + blood group only, mobile masked), broadcast updates, mark attendance, see channel attribution | See any other camp, see donor mobiles, RSVP donors directly |

---

## 3. Public surfaces (no login required)

The platform is **donor-conversion-driven**, so several pages are public:

| URL | What it is |
|-----|------------|
| `/` | Landing page (Raktify wordmark, hero, three pillars, partner CTAs) |
| `/login` | Donor login (mobile + OTP) |
| `/register` | Donor registration wizard (4 steps: pre-screening → details → temporary deferral notice → consent + OTP + finalisation) |
| `/staff/login` | Institutional staff login (email + password + TOTP) |
| `/onboarding/apply` | Hospital / blood bank self-apply form |
| `/camps/host` | **Public camp-host application form** — Rotary clubs, schools, corporates, panchayats, NGOs, anyone |
| `/c/<slug>` | **Public camp landing page** — the URL camp organizers share. RSVP CTA branches on auth state. Carries `?via=<channel>` for attribution. |
| `/camp/<token>` | **Camp organizer magic-link dashboard** — no signup, scoped to one camp |

All public endpoints are rate-limited (100 req/IP/min global, 3/h/mobile on
OTP send, 10/15min/IP on institutional login).

---

## 4. Donor experience

### 4.1 Registration
4-step wizard at `/register`:

1. **Pre-screening** — DRAFT bank of permanent-deferral questions (loaded from `GET /donors/eligibility/questions`). Any "YES" produces a soft decline.
2. **Personal details** — full name, DOB, gender, self-reported blood group (display-only, never used in matching), village/taluka/district picker, preferred language.
3. **Temporary deferral notice** — informational; subsequent questions about recent illness / travel.
4. **Consent + OTP + finalisation** — submits to `POST /donors/register`, sends OTP via `POST /auth/otp/send`, verifies via `POST /auth/otp/verify`, posts `POST /donors/:id/consent`.

When the URL is `/register?camp=<slug>`, the camp slug is persisted in `sessionStorage` and the wizard finishes by redirecting to `/c/<slug>` where an auto-RSVP fires.

### 4.2 Login
`/login` — mobile OTP. Returns JWT.

In staging, `OTP_ECHO=true` is set so the OTP appears inline (`dev_otp echoed by backend: 123456`) for live demo without SMS.

### 4.3 Donor dashboard (`/donor`)
- **Pending-sync banner** when the IndexedDB outbox has queued writes (offline-capable availability toggle).
- **Availability card** — full-width red-on-cream toggle, the spec §7.6 "single big tap" UX. Optimistic update + outbox replay when reconnected.
- **Donor tier badge** — Bronze (1 donation) / Silver (5) / Gold (10) / Champion (25) progress bar with medal colour, plus an estimated-lives-saved counter.
- **4 stat cards** — verified blood group, total donations, next eligible date, reliability score.
- **Upcoming camps section** — district-scoped list with one-tap "I will be there" RSVP, "Cancel RSVP" toggle, deferral warning if applicable.
- **Donation history** — last 5 verified / pending donations with TTI clearance verdict per donation (PE / CL / IN — never field-level data).

### 4.4 Donor passport
`GET /donors/me` returns a comprehensive profile: identity, blood group (verified + self-reported separately labelled), eligibility (deferral status / until date / next-eligible date / eligible components), community, stats (total donations, units, reliability), location (district/taluka/village ids), donations history, overall clearance.

### 4.5 Privacy invariants
- Self-reported blood group is rendered as "Self-reported (unverified): O+" with visual distinction. Never queried in matching.
- TTI field-level results are NEVER in the passport response — only the overall verdict (`PE` pending / `CL` clear / `IN` investigation / `HD` held).
- Mobile is encrypted at rest; mask `+91XXXXX1234` (last 4 only) when hospital-facing.

---

## 5. Hospital portal (`/hospital`)

3 tabs:

### 5.1 Dashboard (default tab)
Source: `GET /requests/dashboard`. 90-day window.

- **5 KPI cards** — Open requests, Critical now, Fulfilled this month, Expired this month, Avg time-to-fulfilment (raised → fulfilled in `h m`).
- **District blood availability grid** — 8 blood groups × N components, district-wide counts. Bag IDs are never exposed.
- **Recent activity** — last 8 closed / expired / cancelled requests with urgency pill and date.
- **Raise request CTA** that jumps to the Raise tab.

### 5.2 My requests
Source: `GET /requests/mine`. Polls every 30 s.

- Per-request card: urgency pill (CR red / UR amber / PL grey), request number, status, fulfilled/required counts, raised time, needed-by, coordinator, matched blood bank.
- **Confirm crossmatch** CTA shown when status is FU/PF and `crossmatch_confirmed=FALSE`. Posts `POST /requests/:id/confirm-crossmatch`, flips status FU → CL.

### 5.3 Raise new request
Form maps to `POST /requests` (Tier 1 OH). Validates against the shared client Zod `requestSchema`. Fields: patient initials, age, gender, blood group, phenotype note (optional), component, units, urgency tier (PL/UR/CR), needed-by datetime, clinical indication, ward/bed.

On submit, the backend runs the matching engine synchronously and returns matched bag count + fallback flag.

---

## 6. Blood bank portal (`/bb`)

4 tabs (Dashboard is default):

### 6.1 Dashboard
Source: `GET /inventory/dashboard`.

- **5 KPI cards** — Available units, Expiring <48h (red), Pending TTI (amber), Issued this month, Donations today.
- **Inventory at a glance** — 8 blood groups × N components grid with available / total counts.
- **Incoming requests · your district** — top 10 open requests in this BB's district, urgency-sorted. The Raise-Hand candidate panel for matching.
- **Recent donations** — last 8 with donor name, component, volume, date.

### 6.2 Inventory
- Status filter (QA / AV / RE / IS / TR / EX / RC).
- Bag list with ISBT barcode, blood group, component, volume, status pill, **colour-coded expiry**:
  - > 7 days: green
  - 2–7 days: amber
  - < 48 hours: red.

### 6.3 Record donation
- **Donor lookup by mobile** (`GET /donors/lookup?mobile=`) auto-fills donor ID and shows verified blood group preview + deferral state.
- Posts `POST /donations`. Backend runs `validateDonation()`: deferral status, gap from last donation, Hb/gender thresholds, blood-group-verified requirement. Trigger creates a QA inventory bag.

### 6.4 TTI screening
- Opens any donation_id, accordion for HIV / HBsAg / HCV / Syphilis / Malaria with NR / RR / PE / ID pills.
- Posts `POST /donations/:id/screening` initially.
- **4-eyes verify** button posts `POST /donations/:id/screening/verify`. Backend rejects same-user verify. Flips overall clearance to CL or IN. Cascades trigger lookback + bag recall when any field is RR.

### 6.5 Opening stock
Form posts `POST /inventory/opening-stock` — repeating rows of blood group × component × units × volume. Bags created in source='WB' (legacy WhatsApp pattern). Skips TTI gating (no TTI record).

---

## 7. Coordinator portal (`/coordinator`)

2 tabs (Dashboard is default):

### 7.1 Dashboard
Source: `GET /coordinator/dashboard`. Polls every 20 s.

**Queue KPIs** (district-scoped):
- Open queue (red if > 0)
- Critical now (red)
- Awaiting accept (amber)
- Accepted by you (green)
- Closed this month

**Your impact** panel (from denormalised `coordinators` row):
- Donations facilitated
- Requests fulfilled
- Community donors
- Lives saved estimate (red)
- Reliability score: green ≥ 80 / amber ≥ 50 / red < 50, with median response-time in minutes

**District donor pool**:
- Verified donors count
- Available today (no deferral) — green

**Most urgent open requests** — top 5 with one-click jump to request detail.

**District blood availability** — same grid as hospital dashboard.

### 7.2 Queue
- District-scoped list, 15s refetch.
- Urgency colour-coded.
- Per-row Accept button if unassigned; "accepted" badge if claimed by self.

### 7.3 Request detail (`/coordinator/requests/:id`)
- Clinical card.
- **Action bar**: Accept / Claim / Verify (Tier 3/4 only) / Re-trigger match / Close with bag IDs.
- **Cross-role thread** — post messages with role-visibility scope picker. 20s refetch.

---

## 8. NGO admin portal (`/admin`)

10 tabs (Onboarding is the default landing tab):

### 8.1 Onboarding (default)
The pending-review queue for institution self-applies. Filter pills: Pending license review (PE) / License verified · awaiting MoU (VE) / Active (AC) / Suspended (SU).

- Per-row table: applicant legal name, type (HO/BB), masked contact mobile, applied date, license-verified date.
- **Verify license** action (PE → VE).
- **Send MoU for eSign** action (VE → AC). Returns LeegAlly doc ID + sign URL.
- Webhook `POST /onboarding/mou-signed` auto-provisions the institutional admin platform_user + flips status to AC.

### 8.2 Coordinators
Filter pills: Pending / Active / Suspended / All.
- Verify (id_verified_at + is_active = TRUE)
- Suspend with reason prompt.

### 8.3 Camps
Filter pills: Pending review (default) / Planned / Upcoming (PL+LV) / Completed / Declined.

For pending-review camps:
- "Review →" opens a panel with full submitter details (organiser, contact, role, mobile, email, host notes, training requested + expected volunteers).
- **Verify & approve** — flips PE → PL, mints a `camp_access_tokens` row, returns the **magic-link URL**, shows it inline with copy-to-clipboard + WhatsApp deep-link share + Preview button.
- **Decline** with mandatory 5+ char reason. PE → DC.

For other camps:
- "Roster →" opens an inline panel listing all RSVPs (donor name + blood group + RSVP date).

Plus a **Schedule a camp directly** form for staff-created camps (skips PE → goes straight to PL).

### 8.4 Thalassemia
List of thalassemia patients with overdue / due-soon colour coding (≤ 7 days amber, ≤ 0 days red).
- Enrol form (full name, DOB, gender, blood group, default component, interval days, default units, treating hospital UUID).
- "Record transfusion" one-click — bumps `last_transfusion_date`. Table trigger auto-recomputes `next_transfusion_due`.

### 8.5 Rare blood
List of rare-phenotype donors (Bombay / Rh-null / weak-D / partial-D / MNS / Kell / Duffy).
- Bombay rows highlighted with red badge.
- Enrol form supports **two modes**:
  - "Existing Raktify donor" — paste donor UUID.
  - "Shadow entry" — name + mobile of a known rare-phenotype person not yet on the platform.
- National-broadcast consent flag.

### 8.6 Duplicates
Suspected-duplicate donor pairs.
- Clear flag (false positive).
- Merge — 501 stub. Design notes in `services/donors/merge.js`. Blocked on medical-advisor confirmation of deferral-merge semantics.

### 8.7 Referrals
Institution-referral funnel summary (NE → CO → IN → ON / DC / DR). Conversion rate. Recent referrals list.

### 8.8 Lookback
Open lookback investigations (post-reactive-TTI recall workflow). Red highlight for cases > 14 days.

### 8.9 Audit
Filter form for the `audit_log_safe` view: table, actor UUID, event type, since, until, limit. Plus an on-demand **Run hash-chain integrity check** button (requires `audit_reader` grant which isn't applied yet — see deferred items).

### 8.10 Jobs
Scheduler view with super_admin-only "Run now" button per job:
- `auto_expire` — expire bags past expiry_date
- `stale_reservation_release` — release reservations idle > 4 hours
- `planned_request_upgrade` — auto-bump PL → UR after 24h
- `eligibility_reminder` — nudge donors at next-eligible date
- `escalate_overdue` — ring 2/3/4 widening for overdue requests
- `bot_session_cleanup` — drop WhatsApp bot sessions older than 1h

### 8.11 Reports (separate page `/admin/reports`)
Month picker + 3 report tabs:
- District summary
- Hemovigilance (DHO-eligible)
- Blood bank performance

Both JSON and CSV download supported.

---

## 9. Camp lifecycle

A 5-stage flow with multiple entry surfaces and a magic-link organizer
dashboard. This is one of the most demoable features for May 27.

### 9.1 Apply (public)
URL: `/camps/host`. No login.

Form: organiser type (Corporate / Educational / NGO / Community / Medical college / Other), legal name, cascading state→district→taluka, venue, address, pincode, date, start/end time, target donor count, **volunteer training opt-in with expected volunteer count**, host contact (name, role, mobile, email).

Submit → `POST /camps/apply` → row in `donation_camps` with `status = 'PE'`. Camp slug, QR token, and submitter PII captured.

### 9.2 NGO review
NGO admin opens `/admin` → Camps tab → Pending review (default). Reviews submitter details, then:
- **Verify & approve** → PE → PL. System mints a unique `camp_access_tokens.token`, expires 30 days after `scheduled_date`. Best-effort WhatsApp send to organizer (uses notification chokepoint; falls back to console outbox).
- **Decline** with 5+ char audit-logged reason.

The verify success panel surfaces the **magic-link URL** inline with copy-to-clipboard, WhatsApp share deep-link (pre-filled friendly message), and Preview Dashboard buttons.

### 9.3 Organizer dashboard (magic link)
URL: `/camp/<token>`. **No Raktify login.** Token IS the credential.

The page:
- Header card with camp status, partnered blood bank line, expiry warning.
- **4 KPI cards** — Registered / Attended / No-shows / Units collected.
- **Invite donors share toolkit**:
  - Copy URL button for the `/c/<slug>` public link.
  - **QR code** rendered in Raktify red, with Print button.
  - 4 channel share buttons — WhatsApp (wa.me) / Facebook (sharer.php) / X (intent) / Email (mailto). Each appends `?via=<channel>` for attribution.
  - **Instagram (copy text)** — Instagram has no share API, so the button copies a ready-to-paste message for Story / bio.
- **Where RSVPs came from** — bar list grouped by `referral_channel`.
- **Broadcast box** — 500-char message sent to all RG/AT donors via the notifications chokepoint.
- **Roster table** — donor name + blood group + RSVP date + deferral warning. **Mobile is never exposed.** One-tap Attended / No-show buttons for camp-day attendance.

### 9.4 Public camp landing
URL: `/c/<slug>` (used in share links). Carries `?via=<channel>` for attribution.

- Hero card: date, weekday, time window, venue + address, register count vs target, partnered blood bank.
- **Register CTA** — branches on auth state:
  - Logged-in donor → instant RSVP with attribution.
  - Logged-in non-donor → "you can't RSVP from this seat".
  - Not signed in → `/register?camp=<slug>&via=<via>` for new donors, `/login?return=/c/<slug>?via=<via>` for returning donors.
- After login/registration, the donor lands back on `/c/<slug>` and an effect hook auto-fires the RSVP using sessionStorage marker.
- Educational footer: bring ID, eat normally, donation takes ~10 minutes, TTI testing applies, **mobile never shared with organiser**.

### 9.5 Day-of attendance + post-camp
Organizer opens magic-link dashboard on phone, taps Attended / No-show per donor as they arrive/skip. Blood bank records actual donations against the camp via `donation_history.donation_camp_id`. Trigger keeps `units_collected` denormalised on the camp row.

### Magic-link security properties
- Token = `crypto.randomBytes(24).toString('base64url')` — 32 chars, unguessable.
- Scoped via RLS to ONE camp; a leaked DB connection can't enumerate other camps' rosters.
- Tracks `last_used_at`, `last_used_ip` (TEXT for proxy-mangling tolerance — migration 264), `use_count`.
- Admin can `POST /camps/access/:token/revoke` with audit-logged reason.
- Auto-expires 30 days after camp end.
- Donor mobile is NEVER returned in roster responses.

### Attribution model
The `?via=<channel>` parameter rides every share button. On RSVP, the backend stamps:
- `camp_registrations.source` — coarse bucket: `WB` (web), `QR`, `WA` (WhatsApp bot, distinct from "shared via WhatsApp"), `CO` (coordinator-added).
- `camp_registrations.referral_channel` (TEXT) — fine-grained: `whatsapp` / `facebook` / `instagram` / `twitter` / `email` / `qr` / `direct` / `web`.

Aggregated as a `channel_mix` array in the organizer-dashboard payload.

---

## 10. Patient + rare-blood registries

### 10.1 Thalassemia patients
Schema (`thalassemia_patients`):
- Identity: full_name, DOB, gender, guardian_name, guardian_mobile (paediatric), abha_id (optional).
- Clinical: blood_group_id, diagnosis_subtype, treating_hospital_id, transfusion_interval_days (default 21), last_transfusion_date, next_transfusion_due (trigger auto-computed), default_units, default_component_id.
- Geography: state_id, district_id, village_id.
- Donor pairing: `paired_donor_ids UUID[]` (no separate join table; GIN-indexed).
- Lifecycle: is_active, inactive_reason ('BMT successful', 'deceased'), registered_by_coordinator.

Endpoints:
- `GET /registries/thalassemia` (admin / coord / hospital)
- `POST /registries/thalassemia` (enrol)
- `POST /registries/thalassemia/:id/transfusion` — bumps `last_transfusion_date` (trigger auto-recomputes `next_transfusion_due`).

### 10.2 Rare blood registry
Schema (`rare_blood_registry`):
- `donor_id` (UNIQUE, nullable) — preferred. NULL = "shadow entry".
- Phenotype: phenotype_code, phenotype_description, abo_type, rh_factor, is_bombay.
- Verification: verified_by_institution_id, verified_method ('IAT' / 'Genotyping' / 'Reference panel'), verified_at, verification_doc_storage_key.
- Shadow contact (when donor_id is NULL): contact_name, contact_mobile (encrypted), contact_state_id, contact_district_id, contact_notes.
- Broadcast: broadcast_consent, broadcast_consent_at, national_alert_pause_until.

Endpoints:
- `GET /registries/rare-blood` (admin / coord / BB)
- `POST /registries/rare-blood` (enrol — either donor-linked or shadow)

Frontend tabs (admin):
- Bombay phenotype rows are highlighted with a red `BOMBAY` badge.
- Curated phenotype picker (BOMBAY / RH_NULL / WEAK_D / PARTIAL_D / MNS / KELL_NEG / DUFFY_NEG).

---

## 11. Notifications & WhatsApp

### 11.1 Provider abstraction
`backend/src/services/notifications/index.js` exposes one function:

```js
sendNotification({
  recipientId,     // UUID or +91 mobile
  templateType,    // 'OTP','EMG','THK','REM','CRED','CAMP_LINK','CAMP_ANNC'
  variables,
  channel,         // 'WA' | 'SM' | 'CA' | 'EM'
  language,        // 'mr' | 'hi' | 'en'
  emergencyOverride
})
```

Resolves the recipient (donor UUID → mobile; user UUID → mobile; institution UUID → primary_contact_mobile; or external mobile string). Writes a `notification_log` row with provider code + delivery status. Provider codes:
- `M9` — MSG91 (BSP, DLT-registered)
- `LO` — local console outbox (dev / staging fallback)
- `WC` — **Meta WhatsApp Cloud API direct** (no BSP, no DLT for WA)

Active provider is selected by `NOTIFICATIONS_PROVIDER` env (`console` / `msg91` / `whatsapp_cloud`). Provider is a one-env-var swap; no code change.

### 11.2 WhatsApp Cloud API integration
File: `backend/src/services/notifications/whatsappCloudProvider.js`.

Status: **scaffolded**, blocked on Meta WABA approval. The resubmission with the live `choudhari.ngo` URL is in progress. Once approved, flipping `NOTIFICATIONS_PROVIDER=whatsapp_cloud` and setting `WHATSAPP_*` env vars activates Meta-direct sends, including:
- OTP delivery (Authentication template with body + button copy-code)
- MoU eSign link
- Donor alerts on critical requests
- Camp magic-link delivery to organizers
- Camp broadcasts to roster

### 11.3 WhatsApp bot
File: `backend/src/services/whatsapp/bot.js`.

Two state machines:
- **Donor registration bot** — IDLE → NAME → DOB → GENDER → VILLAGE → CONSENT → COMPLETE. Persists in `bot_sessions` table with 1-hour TTL.
- **Blood-bank inventory parser** — interprets `UPDATE B+ 4 O+ 2` style messages, replies with an admin-confirm link (auto-apply is deferred until a synthetic legacy donor row exists).

Inbound webhook: `POST /webhooks/whatsapp/incoming`.

### 11.4 Notification log
`notification_log` table. One row per send. Tracks:
- recipient_donor_id / recipient_user_id / recipient_institution_id / recipient_external_mobile
- channel, template_type, language, provider
- delivery_status (SE sent / DR delivered / RD read / FA failed / OP opt-out)
- DND override flag for emergencies (post-launch enforcement)
- Provider-level message id + delivery-receipt timestamps

Delivery-status webhook: `POST /webhooks/msg91/delivery` (MSG91). For Meta, webhook lands in a separate route.

When `delivery_status='OP'` (opt-out), a trigger auto-flips `donors.{whatsapp,sms}_opted_in = FALSE`.

---

## 12. Geographic data

### 12.1 Schema
Four tables linked top-down: `states` → `districts` → `talukas` (sub-districts) → `villages`. All keyed by LGD numeric codes (idempotent re-imports). Each table has `is_active BOOLEAN` so the launch scope can be progressively widened without re-importing.

### 12.2 Bulk importer
`scripts/import_lgd.js` — production-ready loader for the Local Government Directory (Ministry of Panchayati Raj). Two modes:
- `--source=api` — live LGD API. Slow (rate-limited; ~600k villages).
- `--source=csv` — CSVs in `LGD_CSV_DIR`. Recommended for production.

Post-import, the script activates Maharashtra (state 27) + Amravati district by default. Activating additional states / districts is a one-line `UPDATE`.

### 12.3 Demo coverage
The demo seed (`scripts/seed_demo.js`) creates Maharashtra + Amravati (501/AMRA) and Pune (502/PUNE) districts, plus a sample taluka and village. Enough for all dropdowns in the onboarding + camp flows.

### 12.4 Public lookup endpoints
- `GET /geography/states` — active states only
- `GET /geography/districts?state_id=27` — active districts
- `GET /geography/talukas?district_id=501` — all (no `is_active` on talukas yet)

Powers the cascading dropdowns in donor registration, institution onboarding, camp host registration, and the admin Schedule-a-Camp form.

---

## 13. Security & privacy invariants

### 13.1 Row-Level Security
Every table has RLS enabled with role-keyed policies:
- `fn_actor_role()`, `fn_actor_user_id()`, `fn_actor_institution_id()`, `fn_is_admin()` — helpers backed by `raktify.*` GUCs.
- Policy bodies kept short; full audit table in `database/migrations/100_rls_phase1.sql` and `200_rls_phase1_extra.sql`.

### 13.2 Audit chain
`audit_log` is INSERT-only, hash-chained (`row_hash` = sha256 over salient fields + previous row_hash). Only the dedicated `audit_writer` Postgres role can INSERT. No application role has UPDATE or DELETE on `audit_log`.

The `audit_log_safe` view masks `row_hash` and `previous_row_hash` so the safe view can be queried by `audit_reader` (and the admin Audit tab). The hash-chain integrity check needs SELECT on the raw columns; a one-line GRANT migration is staged but not yet applied — flagged as a deferred item.

### 13.3 PII handling
**Storage:**
- Fixed-width identifiers (CHAR(N)) — mobile, abha_id, aadhaar_last4 — plaintext in column. Protected by RDS-level + KMS storage encryption + RLS + column-level GRANTs.
- Free-text PII (TEXT) — full_name, address, deferral_reason, screening notes — column-encrypted with AES-256-GCM. Ciphertext format `v1:<provider>:<keyKind>:<base64url>`.

**Two KMS keys for hybrid encryption:**
- `KMS_MAIN_KEY_ARN` — general PII.
- `KMS_SCREENING_KEY_ARN` — TTI screening data only.

A compromised app server with main-key access cannot decrypt screening data without separately compromising the screening key.

**Logger redaction:** `backend/src/config/logger.js` redacts known-sensitive paths. Extend the redact list when adding new fields.

### 13.4 Defence-in-depth
- **Helmet CSP** tightened: `default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'`. We're an API, not an HTML server.
- **CORS whitelist** — `FRONTEND_URL` + `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` only; no wildcard.
- **Global rate limit** — 100 req/IP/min. Stacks under per-route limits (OTP, institutional login).
- **`sanitizeInput` middleware** — strips ASCII control chars, script/iframe bookends, caps strings at 8 KiB. Type coercion stays with Zod, SQL escaping with parameterised queries.
- **ESLint `no-restricted-syntax`** blocks any `c.query(\`... ${userInput} ...\`)`. Five sites have justified `eslint-disable` (Zod-validated whitelists / constant fragments).
- **`app.set('trust proxy', 1)`** so `req.ip` keys correctly behind ALB / Front Door.
- **`cleanClientIp()` helper** (`backend/src/routes/camps.js`) sanitises raw IP strings before Postgres writes (introduced after a 22P02 in the camp magic-link path).

## 15. Database (44 migrations)

Sequential, immutable. Numbered with prefix groups:
- `001–035` — schema (geographic, reference, platform_users, institutions, mou_versions, coordinators, communities, donors, institution_referrals, donation_history, donor_screening, screening_audit_log, blood_inventory, thalassemia_patients, rare_blood_registry, blood_requests, request_assignments, request_documents, donor_alerts, escalation_log, request_threads, donation_camps, notification_log, lookback_registry, audit_log)
- `099` — attach audit triggers
- `100, 200` — RLS phase 1 + extra
- `210, 211, 212` — bug fixes
- `220, 221, 240` — system-role RLS exceptions for routing
- `230` — `bot_sessions`
- `250` — notification provider WC
- `260` — `camp_registrations` join table + count triggers
- `261` — public camp applications (PE/DC statuses, submitter fields)
- `262` — `camp_access_tokens` (magic-link)
- `263` — `referral_channel` on camp_registrations
- `264` — relax `last_used_ip` from INET → TEXT

All migrations end with a `-- ROLLBACK` block. The runner refuses to re-apply a migration whose SHA-256 checksum changed.

## 16. Deployment & infrastructure

### 16.1 Azure resources (staging)
- **DB** — Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server, B1ms (1 vCPU, 2 GB), Central India. SSL required. Firewall whitelist (current dev IP + App Service outbound).
- **Backend** — Azure App Service Linux B1 (Central India). Hosted at `raktify-api-staging-hsdxfzhrg5a7ekes.centralindia-01.azurewebsites.net`. Oryx build with `SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT=true`. Startup command: `node backend/src/server.js`.
- **Frontend** — Azure Static Web Apps Free. Default hostname `jolly-bay-08008c700.azurestaticapps.net`. Custom domain **`raktify.choudhari.ngo`**.
- **DNS** — Cloudflare proxy on `choudhari.ngo`, CNAME for `raktify` → SWA default hostname.

### 16.2 CI/CD
- **Backend** — `.github/workflows/main_raktify-api-staging.yml`. Triggered on push to main. Builds + deploys via Azure-issued OIDC token (federated identity `oidc-msi-bdbb` with Contributor role on the resource group). No SCM Basic auth required.
- **Frontend** — `.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-jolly-bay-08008c700.yml`. Triggered on push to main. Builds with `VITE_API_URL` baked in at build time so the SPA calls the App Service backend directly.

### 16.3 Environment variables (production)
See `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` for the full matrix. Key flags:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL` — postgres connection string (sslmode=require)
- `JWT_SECRET` (≥ 32 random bytes)
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32-byte hex)
- `FRONTEND_URL=https://raktify.choudhari.ngo`
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` — comma-separated CORS whitelist
- `NOTIFICATIONS_PROVIDER` — `console` / `msg91` / `whatsapp_cloud`
- `STORAGE_PROVIDER` — `local` / `s3` (Azure Blob provider is future work)
- `ENCRYPTION_PROVIDER` — `local` / `kms`
- `OTP_ECHO=true` — staging-only; echoes OTPs in API response for demos when no SMS provider is wired.

## 18. Deferred items (deliberate non-goals for the demo)

These are scoped and partially stubbed; the CSR deck lists them as
roadmap items. None are blockers for the 27 May demo.

1. **WhatsApp Cloud API activation** — provider written, waiting on Meta WABA approval.
2. **Pan-India geographic activation** — LGD importer ready, only Maharashtra + Amravati + Pune are active.
3. **WebSocket / Socket.io live queue** — coordinator queue currently polls (15 s). Real-time updates are the next-major-feature.
4. **Workbox BackgroundSync** — offline outbox replays on `online` + on hook mount; doesn't yet leverage the SW BackgroundSync API.
5. **Donor merge endpoint** — 501 stub. Design notes in `services/donors/merge.js`. Blocked on medical-advisor confirmation of deferral merge semantics.
6. **`audit_reader` SELECT grant on raw `audit_log`** for the integrity-check endpoint — one-line migration.
7. **Adverse-transfusion-reactions table** — hemovigilance report returns `{ reported: 0, note: 'adverse_reaction_table_pending' }`.
8. **PDF generation** for DHO submission — CSV exports work; PDF needs Puppeteer / wkhtmltopdf.
9. **DHO contact** (ring 4 escalation) — schema ready; the WhatsApp + voice send is deferred until MSG91 / WhatsApp Cloud lands.
10. **Synthetic legacy donor for opening-stock** — opening-stock currently piggybacks on the BB's first verified donation_id. A clean per-institution synthetic donor is staged.
11. **Distance-based donor sort** — `services/escalation/index.js` sorts by reliability_score; the spec calls for `ST_Distance` once PostGIS is enabled.
12. **NMC registry check** for Tier 2 GH requests — stored as `guest_nmc_check_status='PE'`.
13. **Multi-language deepening** — clinical copy in coord / hospital / BB tabs is English; donor-facing copy is in MR/HI/EN.
14. **Devanagari design pass** — proper type scale + Noto Sans Devanagari + motion / microinteractions.
15. **Camp Captain** (Phase B) and **Coordinator graduation** (Phase C) for camp organizers who want recurring access.
16. **Dynamic Open Graph tags** on `/c/<slug>` for WhatsApp / Facebook share previews.
17. **Camp poster upload** — schema has `poster_storage_key`, UI to upload is pending.
18. **Map view + GPS donor search** — needs PostGIS or managed tile provider.
19. **Aadhaar XML KYC** — needs UIDAI AUA/KUA licence.
20. **Insurance integration** (Ayushman Bharat / PMJAY) — needs state-health-mission MoU.
21. **IoT cold-chain integration** — schema and notification chokepoint are ready; needs hardware partner + MQTT broker.
